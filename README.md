<h1>You want to be a millionaire or not?</h1>
the idea for this game comes from the very popular TV game show "Who wants to be a millionaire?"
However, there is a slight twist to it as instead of just usual trivia questions, this is more singaporean trivia style
the inspiration for this comes from my little brother who is in secondary school, and he likes to read up on all these "did you know?" kind of facts from all over the world

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
this is a very simple game to play. there will be a total of 10 questions to answer. for each question you answer correctly, the amount of money in your bank will increase. after each correct question answered, you have the choice to either continue on to the next question (potentially increasing your bank), or you can choose to quit and withdraw the money in your bank. However, once you answer a question wrongly, you will lose all the money in your bank and go home.
